This was an ongoing assignment to learn MySQL. 

It is used to create and track projects you may have. I included the difficulty of putting on a hat, and the painstaking process of mowing the lawn as examples.

It was my first experience with DBeaver and MySQL editor, and I used eclipse for the fun coding parts.

When using it practically, I would probably create a weekly project called making a sandwich.

Thanks!
